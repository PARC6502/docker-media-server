# [Docker media server](https://github.com/PARC6502/docker-media-server)

## Containers

- Traefik - reverse proxy, I've set it up so all \*.yourdomain domains go to the machine with the media server, then traefik makes it so service_name.yourdomain goes to the right service
- Jellyfin - media server
- Sonnarr - tv downloader
- Radarr - movie downloader
- Ombi - requester for radarr & sonarr
- Deluge - torrent client, required for downloaders to work
- Jackett - Torrent tracker api, required for downloaders to work
- NZBGet - Usenet client, required for usenet downloads to work

I'm using this setup alongside a DNS server (dnsmasq). The DNS server allows devices inside my network to access the media server through a domain. Some routers will allow you to do this, and it can also be done by pihole/adguard home/other DNS based ad blockers. You can view my DNS server setup [here.](https://github.com/PARC6502/docker-dns-dhcp)

## Caveats

- I'm still doing port mapping, but it's not needed with Traefik, and if your machine is publicly accessible you definitely want to lock down ports (I know nothing about security so if it will be public do your own research)
- Traefik is only accessible by IP `<your IP>:9090/api/rawdata`
- This is still a new setup so I've not tested it much

## Setup

These instructions all assume that you're on a linux machine that already has docker and docker compose setup.

After cloning this repo...

1. Copy the example.env and give it your own variables

```bash
cp example.env .env
nano .env
```

2. Create the folders needed for the setup, replace the vars with actual directories unless you've put them in the bash environment

```bash
mkdir -p jellyfin/config jellyfin/cache sonarr radarr ombi deluge jackett nzbget ${DLDIR}/completed ${DLDIR}/incomplete ${MOVIESDIR} ${TVDIR}
```

(I've seen that some people need to change the permissions on the content folder, if you do `chmod -R 0777 content/` should work, although changing folder ownership is probs a better option)

3. Setup your DNS so that all \*.yourdomain go to the media server. Your domain doesn't have to be registered since it will only be used internally

4. Fire up the docker containers

```bash
# Make sure you're running this command from inside the docker-media-server folder and that the .env file is inside the same folder
sudo docker-compose up -d
# The command will take a bit, after it runs you can run the following to check all the containers are running
sudo docker-compose ps
```

If this is all setup correctly visiting your domain or the ip address of your machine should open Heimdall, and `<your ip>:8112` should open the Deluge web ui

5. Setup all the containers

   - Deluge needs to be setup to download to `/downloads/incomplete` and move completed downloads to `/downloads/completed`
   - Nzbget needs to be setup if you plan on using a Usenet provider. Provide it with the credentials for your usenet provider.
   - You need to add some torrent trackers to Jackett
   - For sonarr and radarr you need to connect them to deluge and to the trackers you set up on Jackett. You may also need to click add movie/add series and setup the path to be `/movies` and `/tv` respectively.
   If you're using usenet then you need to configure Sonarr and Radarr to use a Usenet indexer. One such indexer is nzbgeek.info where you need to register.
   - Ombi needs to be connected to sonarr, radarr and jellyfin. You could also set up passwordless login if you're only going to be using it on your network
   - IIRC you just need to go through the setup wizard for Jellyfin
   - Add links to everything on Heimdall

## Updating

If you've made changes to the docker compose file you'll need to stash them for the git pull to work

```bash
git stash
```

```bash
git pull
sudo docker-compose up -d --force-recreate --build
```
